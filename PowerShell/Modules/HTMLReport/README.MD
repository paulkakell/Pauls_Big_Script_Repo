# HTMLReportModule
PowerShell Module used for formatting static HTML reports created with PowerShell scripts.

<p>I created this module to provide a consistant look and feel for reporting I was doing out of AD/AAD for executive teams.  This is used primairily in scripts which are going to return a tabled dataset and allows for a variety of parameters.
